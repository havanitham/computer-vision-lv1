This is a project to detect pills in images using OpenCV.  
---

## Steps Performed
1. Read multiple images from a list  
2. Convert each image to **grayscale**  
3. Apply **Gaussian blur** to remove noise  
4. Use **Canny edge detection** to find edges  
5. Find and draw **contours** around pills  
6. Show the number of pills detected
